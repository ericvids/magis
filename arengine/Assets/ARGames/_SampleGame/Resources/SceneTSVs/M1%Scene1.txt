				Aria#Well done. I hope your trip here was not too difficult?
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#As you can see, visiting another location will require you to physically travel there and focus on a specific marker with your Spirit Gear.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#However, you can only travel to these locations if your duties require that you be present there.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Thankfully, your Spirit Gear's map screen will only display these relevant locations and will filter out everything else.
				@animate Agent_Aria Yes
				Aria#Assuming no spiritual interference, that is.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Now, our primary duty as members of M.A.G.I.S. is to ensure that none of the paranormal entities here make their way to your world.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#This is the reason we investigate events that seem out of place.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#If anything or anyone here starts acting up, it could be because of energy spilling into this world from yours.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#It's a dangerous job, which is why you need to be prepared. We need to recharge your Spirit Gear so you can use its additional functions.

			Progress==3	@animate Agent_Aria Talk

				@animate Agent_Aria Talk

		Examine	-	Barrier stones such as this one are employed by the Department of M.A.G.I.S. as proximity-triggered traps.
				Unwitting paranormal entities that wander too close will find themselves imprisoned inside a mystical force field.
				Be advised that the force field's area of effect cannot cover the barrier stone itself.
