				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Oh? No one told you? It's that rectangular device you're using. What was it called in your world again? Smartphone? Tablet?
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Spirit Gear technology turns your device into a special tool that allows you to see otherworlders like me. All you need to do is look through it.

				Aria#Excellent.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Whenever you {Examine} someone or something, your Spirit Gear will access our department's database and provide more information.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#This is particularly useful when you want to learn more about whoever or whatever is in front of you.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#By the way, have you noticed that no matter what you do, your position here in the other world seems to remain the same?
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#It's a limitation of the Spirit Gear. But it's useful if, for example, you need to move out of someone's way in your world.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Now, I will call a friend over, and I would like you to {Talk} to him.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk

				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#When you need to change locations, a {Depart} command should appear in your Spirit Gear's interface. Selecting it has two functions.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#First, it will sever your connection with this world. After all, isn't it difficult to walk around while having to look at your device all the time?
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Your own well-being in your world should be your utmost priority. {Always watch out for moving vehicles and other potential dangers.}
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#I cannot assist you in your world should you get hurt or should anything happen to your device. Do remain vigilant at all times.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Where was I? Ah, the {Depart} command. Tapping it will bring up a map screen that will also display your next destination.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Now, I want you to {Depart} and go to the location indicated by the red icon.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Once you arrive, the map screen will display an image of the "marker" that will act as a connection point.
				@animate Agent_Aria Talk
				Aria#Your Spirit Gear will tell you what to do once you've gotten that far. If all goes well, it will reconnect you to the other world. Good luck!
